% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
This paper provides a sample of a \LaTeX\ document which conforms,
somewhat loosely, to the formatting guidelines for
ACM SIG Proceedings. It is an {\em alternate} style which produces
a {\em tighter-looking} paper and was designed in response to
concerns expressed, by authors, over page-budgets.
It complements the document \textit{Author's (Alternate) Guide to
Preparing ACM SIG Proceedings Using \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and Bib\TeX}.
This source file has been written with the intention of being
compiled under \LaTeX$2_\epsilon$\ and BibTeX.

The developers have tried to include every imaginable sort
of ``bells and whistles", such as a subtitle, footnotes on
title, subtitle and authors, as well as in the text, and
every optional component (e.g. Acknowledgments, Additional
Authors, Appendices), not to mention examples of
equations, theorems, tables and figures.

To make best use of this sample document, run it through \LaTeX\
and BibTeX, and compare this source code with the printed
output produced by the dvi file. A compiled PDF version
is available on the web page to help you with the
`look and feel'.

\section{Introduction}
Data center.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work,

\section{Related Work}
In this section, we will present various relevant works including failure detectors, failure detection architecture in distributed systems and failure detection in data center networks.

\subsection{Failure Detectors}
A failure detector(FD) is widely recognized as an oracle to intelligently suspect failed processes \cite{chandra1996unreliable}. The monitored process periodically send heartbeat messages to its detector to prove its liveness.

Chen et al. proposed a FD that provides QoS \cite{chen2002quality}. It estimates the expected arrival time(EAs) of the next heartbeat message according to a slide window storing n most recent arrived messages. EAs determine the deadline that the detector will wait for the next heartbeat before suspecting the monitored process. \textit{Chen FD} can adjust current network condition and set the timeout threshold adaptively by referring to recent heartbeats. Bertier et al. proposed a similar FD \cite{bertier2002implementation}, whereas it uses a dynamic way to compute error margin of \textit{Chen FD}. Other FDs like \textit{$\phi$ Accrual FD} \cite{hayashibara2004varphi} and \textit{Satzger FD} \cite{satzger2007new} can output a continuous accrual failure value other than a binary value at any time which stands for the failure probability of the process.

\subsection{Failure Detection Architecture}
A failure detection architecture aims to provide the service of monitoring nodes in large scale distributed systems in a scalable way. Roughly speaking, there are two kinds of architectures. The first one is hierarchical architecture \cite{felber1999failure}, all the nodes are partitioned into different groups, each group has a leader node. Within a group, the leader node is responsible for monitoring all the nodes. Leader nodes periodically send node status information of his group to other leader nodes. Hierarchical architecture can reduce the number of heartbeat messages effectively, but it exists \textit{Single Point of Failure} problem, when the leader node crashes, it needs to select a new leader.
Another alternative solution is Gossip-Style architecture \cite{van1998gossip}. Each node maintains a list containing the \textit{heartbeat counter} for all the nodes in the system. Every T$_{gossip}$ seconds, each node firstly update \textit{heartbeat counter} of itself and then randomly select another node to send its list to. Upon receiving a message, the node will merge two lists and update each node's \textit{heartbeat counter} with the bigger one. If the \textit{heartbeat counter} does not update after T$_{fail}$ seconds, the node will be marked as crashed. If the \textit{heartbeat counter} does not update after T$_{cleanup}$(T$_{cleanup}$
$\ge$T$_{fail}$) seconds, it will be removed from the list. This approach has very low bandwidth occupation because it only produces $n$ messages each epoch where $n$ is the size of the system.

\subsection{Failure Detection in Data Center Networks}
There exists a large body of work on applying statistical approaches to failure localization in data center networks.
